        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I am a student currently taking B.S.I.T in Asia Pacific College, 
            I also graduated Senior High School in the STEM Track.
            We also had a short internship period on our last SHS Term.
            I was an intern at the MobileApp team in Accenture for 3 months
            Working mainly on a Hybrid App.

            My hobbies are mostly Tech-related such as Gaming and Photography.
            I like to read about tech-news and tinker around with computers.
